# 🧠 Mental Health Text Classification Model

This project builds a machine-learning model to classify mental-health related text into categories such as:

- neutral  
- depression  
- anxiety  
- stress

It uses TF-IDF vectorization and multiple scikit-learn classifiers to evaluate model performance.
